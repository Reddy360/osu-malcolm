# osu-malcolm

A man in the middle proxy for adding new features for osu! web endpoints and Bancho

Malcolm will probably consist of:
  * Redirecting of shift F12 screenshots to whatever screenshot service you desire, like animegirlsare.sexy
  * Storing of beatmap scores to allow for country and friend rankings to be handled outside osu!
  * osu! beatmap mirror
  * Hijacking requests for friend or country scores to display our own data
  * More chat channels than osu!, maybe group chats will be possible
  * Free supporter
  * Support to direct all traffic for user through proxy/VPN
  * Auto timezone setting to make osu! think you're in a different country
  * Support for custom bots in Bancho
  * Scoreboards on unranked maps
